# T18A

### Q1b

A → B could hold

B → A does not hold

A → C does not hold

a → 1

b → 1

c → 1

✅ still holds, does not have to be unique values

### Q2

1. A+ = {A, B}
2. ACEG+ = {A, B, C, E, F, G}
3. BD+ = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}

### Real Example

zid | name | birthday

zid → name

zid → birthday

zid+ = {zid, name, birthday}

### Q3

1. ACD+ = {A, B, C, D, E}
    
    CDE+ = {A, B, C, D, E}
    
    BCD+ = {A, B, C, D, E}
    
2. in 3NF
3. not in BCNF

### Q4a

1. B+ = {A, B, C, D}
2. BD
3. BCD, ABC
4. A
5. AB, CD, BC, AD
6. A

### Q4b

1. not in BCNF
2. not in BCNF
3. not in BCNF
4. not in BCNF
5. not in BCNF
6. in BCNF

### Q4c

1. not in 3NF
2. not in 3NF
3. in 3NF
    - D is single attribute of candidate key BCD
    - A is single attribute of candidate key ABC
4. not in 3NF
5. in 3NF
6. in 3NF
    - because already in BCNF, we don’t need to check again

### Q5

```
Team(name, captain)
name -> captain
in BCNF

Player(name, teamPlayedFor)
name -> teamPlayedFor
in BCNF

Fan(name, address)
name -> address
in BCNF

TeamColours(teamName, colour)
teamName colour -> teamname colour
^ trivial functional dependency
in BCNF, all FDs are trivial

FavouriteColours(fanName, colour)
in BCNF, all FDs are trivial

FavouritePlayers(fanName, playerName)
in BCNF, all FDs are trivial

FavouriteTeams(fanName, teamName)
in BCNF, all FDs are trivial
```

### Account Table Example

Acc(accountNo, balance, customer, branch, address, assets)

**************************Candidate Key**************************

accountNo

****FDs****

accountNo → balance

accountNo → customer

accountNo → branch

accountNo → address

accountNo → assets

branch → assets

********BCNF Normalisation********

split table (choose branch → assets)

(branch, assets) {branch → assets} key: branch ⇒ BCNF

(accountNo, balance, customer, branch, address) {accountNo → balance, customer, branch, address} key: accountNo ⇒ BCNF

result

(branch, assets)

(accountNo, balance, customer, branch, address)

### Q7i

**a**

candidate key: B

fd: {C → D, C → A, B → C}

minimal cover: {C → AD, B → C}

split into tables

ACD, BC

need relation with key?

no we don’t because candidate key B is already in table BC

result

ACD, BC

ACD {C → AD}

BC {B → C}

****b****

candidate key: BD

fd: {B → C, D → A}

minimal cover: {B → C, D → A}

split into tables

BC, AD

need relation with key?

yes BD

result

BC, AD, BD

**c**

candidate key: BCD, ABC

**d**

candidate key: A

fd: {*A → B,   BC → D,   A → C*}

minimal cover: {A → BC, BC → D}

split into tables

ABC, BCD

need relation with key?

no ABC already has key A

result

ABC, BCD

**e**

candidate key: AB, CD, BC, AD

**f**

candidate key: A

### Q7ii

**a**

candidate key: B

fd: {C → D, C → A, B → C}

minimal cover: {C → AD, B → C}

****************if we choose {C → AD}****************

split table ABCD (choose C → AD)

CAD {C → AD} key: C ⇒ in BCNF

BC {B → C} key: B ⇒ in BCNF

result

CAD, BC

********if we choose {B → C}********

split table ABCD (choose B → C)

BC {B → C} key: B ⇒ in BCNF

ABD {} key: ABD ⇒ in BCNF

result

BC, ABD

****b****

candidate key: BD

fd: {B → C, D → A}

minimal cover: {B → C, D → A}

split table ABCD (choose B → C)

BC {B → C} key: B ⇒ in BCNF

ABD {D → A} key: BD ⇒ not in BCNF

split table ABD (choose D → A)

AD {D → A} key: D ⇒ in BCNF

BD {} key: BD ⇒ in BCNF

result

BC, AD, BD

**c**

candidate key: BCD, ABC

**d**

candidate key: A

fd: {*A → B,   BC → D,   A → C*}

minimal cover: {A → BC, BC → D}

split table ABCD (choose A → BC)

ABC {A → BC} key: A ⇒ in BCNF

AD {} key: AD ⇒ in BCNF

result

ABC, AD

**e**

candidate key: AB, CD, BC, AD

**f**

candidate key: A
