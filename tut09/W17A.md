2. ACEG+ = {A, B, C, E, F, G}
3. BD+ = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}

B+ = {B}

D+ = {D, F}

### Q3a

ACD+ = {A, B, C, D, E}

### Q4a

1. B
2. BD
3. ABC, BCD
4. A+ = {A, B, C, D}
5. AB, CD, BC+ = {A, B, C, D}, AD+ {A, B, C, D}
6. A

### Q4b

1. not in BCNF
2. not in BCNF
3. not in BCNF
4. not in BCNF
5. not in BCNF
6. in BCNF
    - A is a super key

### Q4c

1. not in 3NF
2. not in 3NF
3. in 3NF
    - A is a single attribute of candidate key ABC
    - ABC is a super key
4. not in 3NF
5. in 3NF
    - AB is a super key
    - A is a single attribute of candidate key AB
    - B is a single attribute of candidate key AB
6. in 3NF
    - in BCNF so definitely in 3NF, no need to check

### Accounts Table Example

Acc(accountNo, balance, customer, branch, address, assets)

************Candidate Key************

accountNo

******Functional Dependencies******

accountNo → balance customer branch address assets

branch → asset address

****************in BCNF?****************

not in BCNF, branch is not a super key

**************in 3NF?**************

not in 3NF, asset nor address is a single attribute of candidate key accountNo

************************************BCNF Decomposition************************************

split table (accountNo, balance, customer, branch, address, assets) (choose branch → asset address)

branch, asset, address {branch → asset address} key = branch ⇒ in BCNF

accountNo, balance, customer, branch {accountNo → balance customer branch} key = accountNo ⇒ in BCNF

result

branch, asset, address

accountNo, balance, customer, branch

### Q5

```
Team(name, captain)
name -> captain
in BCNF because name is a super key

Player(name, teamPlayedFor)
name -> teamPlayedFor
in BCNF because name is a super key

Fan(name, address)
name -> address
in BCNF because name is a super key

TeamColours(teamName, colour)
no non-trivial functional dependencies
in BCNF because all functional dependencies are trivial

FavouriteColours(fanName, colour)
no non-trivial functional dependencies
in BCNF because all functional dependencies are trivial

FavouritePlayers(fanName, playerName)
no non-trivial functional dependencies
in BCNF because all functional dependencies are trivial

FavouriteTeams(fanName, teamName)
no non-trivial functional dependencies
in BCNF because all functional dependencies are trivial
```

### Q7i

**a**

candidate key(s): B

fds = {*C → D,   C → A,   B → C*}

split into tables

CAD, BC

need relation with key?

no BC already has key B

result

CAD, BC

**b**

candidate key(s): BD
